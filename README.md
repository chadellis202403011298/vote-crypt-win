# ElectionBet - Encrypted Election Prediction Market

A privacy-preserving election prediction market built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on Ethereum Sepolia testnet. Users can place encrypted bets on election outcomes where candidate choices and bet amounts remain completely private until results are officially declared.

## üéØ Features

- **Complete Privacy**: All predictions are encrypted using Zama FHE before submission to the blockchain
- **Secure Betting**: Candidate selection and bet amounts are processed as ciphertext on-chain
- **Fair Settlement**: Automated payout distribution based on encrypted vote tallies
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React + shadcn/ui
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless wallet connection with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Safe

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract Layer
- **ElectionBettingPool.sol**: Main contract managing encrypted predictions
  - Uses `@fhevm/solidity` for FHE operations
  - Implements fail-closed security model
  - Role-based access control for election management
  - Gateway decryption for payouts

### Frontend Layer
- **React + Vite**: Fast development and optimized production builds
- **Wagmi v2 + RainbowKit**: Web3 wallet connectivity
- **Zama FHE SDK**: Browser-based encryption (v0.2.0)
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautiful, accessible component library
- **TanStack Query**: Efficient blockchain data fetching

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Sepolia ETH for gas fees
